% Write a function that is called like this: amag = accelerate(F1,F2,m). 
%   F1 and F2 are three-element column vectors that represent two forces 
%   applied to a single object. The argument m equals the mass of the 
%   object in units of kilograms. The three elements of each force equal 
%   the x, y, and z components of the force in Newtons. The output 
%   variable amag is a scalar that is equal to the magnitude of the 
%   object’s acceleration. The function calculates the object’s 
%   acceleration vector a by using Newton’s law: F = ma, where F is the 
%   sum of F1 and F2. Then it returns the magnitude of a. Hint: we are 
%   talking about physical vectors here, so the Pythagorean theorem will 
%   come in handy.
%
% input 1: F1, three element column vector representing the first force  to
%       applied a single object
% input 2: F2, three element colum vector representing the second force
%       applied a single object
% input 3: m, the mass of the object in kg
% output: amag, a scalar equal to the magnitude of the acceleration

function a = accelerate(F1,F2,m)
    F = F1 + F2;                    % F from Newton's law
    f = sqrt(sum(F.^2));            % 
    a = f/m;
end

% Solution:

function a = accelerate(F1,F2,m)
    F = F1 + F2;
    f = sqrt(sum(F.^2));
    a = f/m;
end
